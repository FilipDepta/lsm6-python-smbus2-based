"""
The sensor outputs provided by the library are the raw
16-bit values obtained by concatenating the 8-bit high and
low accelerometer and gyro data registers. They can be
converted to units of g and dps (degrees per second) using
the conversion factors specified in the datasheet for your
particular device and full scale setting (gain).

Example: An LSM6DS33 gives an accelerometer Z axis reading
of 16276 with its default full scale setting of +/- 2 g. The
LA_So specification in the LSM6DS33 datasheet (page 15)
states a conversion factor of 0.061 mg/LSB (least
significant bit) at this FS setting, so the raw reading of
16276 corresponds to 16276 * 0.061 = 992.8 mg = 0.9928 g.
